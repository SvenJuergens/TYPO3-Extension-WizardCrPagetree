Pagetree Wizard
===============

Wizard that will create a page tree for you. Feed it with a space indented tree structure of the desired pages and the pages will be created for you.

I made this extension because I found the create multiple pages wizard to be too limiting. We often run into people who have a complete sitemap available up front. It would be nice if this map could be imported into the page tree at once.

You can feed the wizard a space, tab or dot-indented list of titles. It will then create a page tree based on this input.

You can also specify additional fields on every line. This enables you to easily fill fields like subtitle or alias.

C-style comments (single and multi line) as well as empty lines are ignored.
